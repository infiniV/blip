Did you know that a simple two-letter word has been a universal greeting across cultures and languages for thousands of years, a symbol of friendship and respect that can instantly brighten up someone's day, and yet, its power to bring people together is often overlooked in our fast-paced world, a world where we're more likely to be glued to our screens than to look up and smile at the person standing right in front of us, but the truth is, this two-letter word has the incredible ability to break down barriers, to transcend language and cultural differences, to make us feel seen and heard, and to create a sense of belonging that's hard to find elsewhere, so let's take a moment to appreciate the magic of this little word, the word that's been a cornerstone of human connection for centuries, the word that's been whispered in love, shouted in celebration, and spoken in sorrow, the word that's been a constant in an ever-changing world, the word that's... hello.
